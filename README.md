# README2Filth: A Command Line README Generator
![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

Using node.js, the inquirer package and the starter code repository (found at https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma), we created a command line application that asks users questions and generates them a professionally styled README for their projects. This README was actually made using README2filth's generator! Give it a go and enjoy peace of mind knowing you have all your README bases covered.

## Usage

To use my application, simply clone the repository into your directory of choice, open its 'develop' directory in your integrated terminal, make sure inquirer is installed and run 'node index.js' in your terminal. After answering all the questions, your README should appear in the README2filth directory, ready to upload to your repository.
